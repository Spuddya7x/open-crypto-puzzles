# LuckyLurker Seed Riddles (80,000 sats, [OPEN])

The crypto-casino affiliate site luckylurker.com published a Bitcoin puzzle on
its own "Bitcoin Vault" page in March 2026: 12 hints, labeled "Word #1" through
"Word #12", each pointing at one word of a 12-word BIP39 seed in a fixed 1:1
position. Four hints send the reader to a specific review article on the same
site, where exactly one word is marked in italics; all four marked words are
valid BIP39 words, giving 4 of 12 words as ground truth. The other 8 hints are
one-line riddles with no such structural marker. I searched about 2 million
position-combinations of plausible synonyms for those 8 riddles against the
known 4 words, with zero exact match, which tells me the true words are not
inside the obvious synonym sets I tried. The lock here is interpretation, not
computation: once the 8 words are pinned, checking a full candidate takes a
fraction of a second.

## The puzzle as published

The vault page lists 12 hints labeled by position. Four point at a specific
article on the same site and are quoted here in full since they name the
mechanism directly: hint 3, "The word is hidden inside this article. It's
marked visually, so you can't miss it if you look closely," points to the
site's crypto-casinos guide; hint 5, "Find it inside the review of our #1 rated
CS2 gambling site for 2026," points to the Gamdom review; hint 8, "Just read N1
Casino review. The word is already there," points to the N1 review; hint 9,
"The quickest path still needs a second thought. Find the article on the site.
The word is there," points to a withdrawal-speed article. In each of the four
target articles, exactly one word is wrapped in an italic tag that is not part
of any icon, and that word is a valid BIP39 word. The other 8 hints are
one-line riddles with no comparable marker: for example, hint 1 reads
"Presence without permanence," hint 4 reads "Born twice, seen once," and hint
12 reads "A single mark on a map, or the act of finding it." Hint 2 describes a
domain ruled by a crown; hint 7 is a half-finished, self-referential line about
the hunt itself, cut off before it names anything. All 12 hints, captured
verbatim, are in [data/hints.csv](data/hints.csv).

## What is understood

### Mechanism

The page's own labeling fixes the order: hint N is seed word N, so word order is
not a separate unknown. Positions 3, 5, 8, and 9 are fixed by the italic-tag
device above: `unveil`, `deposit`, `grid`, `remind`. The other 8 positions (1, 2,
4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12) are open. A full 12-word candidate is checked by BIP39
checksum, then derived under BIP84 with an empty passphrase; BIP49 and BIP44 are
checked as a fallback since the page never states the path.

### Derivation and oracle

```
python3 tools/oracle.py --selftest
python3 tools/oracle.py "w1 w2 ... w12"
```

### Certified against

No solved puzzle exists on this site to calibrate against, so
`tools/oracle.py --selftest` certifies the derivation path against the public
BIP39/BIP84 test vector: the mnemonic "abandon" repeated 11 times plus "about"
derives to `bc1qcr8te4kr609gcawutmrza0j4xv80jy8z306fyu` under
`m/84'/0'/0'/0/0`. Reproduced 2026-08-16.

### Established facts

1. The escrow is funded and unspent as of 2026-08-16 (checked via
   [mempool.space](https://mempool.space)); 2 funding transactions of 40,000
   sats each, none spent.
2. 4 of 12 words are fixed with high confidence: each of the 4 target articles
   contains exactly one non-icon italic word, and all 4 are valid BIP39 words.
3. Across 3 saved candidate pools and 3 derivation paths, about 2 million
   position-combinations were checked with the 4 known words fixed, yielding
   about 125,000 checksum-valid full mnemonics, none matching the address.

## What has been tested

| Hypothesis | Space | Method | Result | Witness | Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| The 8 riddle words are all inside plausible synonym pools | about 2,000,000 position-combinations across 3 pools and 3 derivation paths | BIP39 checksum filter, then BIP84/BIP49/BIP44 derivation and exact address match | about 125,000 checksum-valid mnemonics, 0 match | uncertified: no known-good candidate was planted in the pool to prove the sweep would have caught it | 2026-08-04 |

One dictionary fact worth knowing before interpreting hint 10: `research` and `study` are
not BIP39 words. "The systematic pursuit of the unknown" cannot be either of the two most
natural English answers, and the in-dictionary readings are `science`, `inquiry`, `search`
and `survey`. The three riddles I would now bet on are hint 2 `kingdom`, hint 11 `umbrella`
("it only works when it's open, and it's there to shield you") and hint 12 `spot`, which
carries the riddle's own noun-and-verb pun. Full pools and sweep results:
[analysis/tested.md](analysis/tested.md).

## Open leads, ranked

1. **Wait for or request the site's own canonical answer** (needs a person or
   external information). The vault page released all 12 hints at once and
   remains the only place a confirmation could come from at no cost. Once about
   7 of the 8 riddle words are confidently pinned, checksum plus the 4 known
   words reduce the rest to a sub-second exact-match check.
2. **Re-check the other 8 articles for the same italic-tag device** (minutes).
   The marker is confirmed on 4 of 12 target articles; whether it extends to
   any of the remaining riddle-linked pages has not been checked.
3. **Free two riddle positions at once over the whole wordlist** (hours). One free
   position with the rest at their top-3 readings is already swept; the next step up is
   every pair drawn from the five vaguest riddles (1, 4, 6, 7, 10), which is 10 pairs
   times 2048 squared, about 2.6 million derivations. Confirmed by a match; killed by a
   clean witnessed sweep, which would say the fault is in a reading I currently trust or
   in the derivation path rather than in two riddles at once.
