# FTPK Season 4: Something in Common (168.000000 USDC, [OPEN])

FTPKgame (@FTPKgame on X), the same author behind the Season 2 puzzle in this repository,
launched a fourth season on 2026-07-16: 12 independent mini-games, each worth one English
BIP39 word, unlocking an Ethereum wallet holding USDC. The author funded the escrow before
announcing it and has topped it up more than once since, most recently confirmed by a
tweet about an extra dollar added after someone used the paid checker. I mirrored the
full site, certified the BIP44 derivation, and established one word with confidence and a
second as a strong candidate. The author's own hint says most of the 12 games share one
common mechanic; the leading reading is that each produces a number usable as a BIP39
wordlist index.

## The puzzle as published

The site (`findtheprivatekeys4.vercel.app`) lists 12 games described by the author as
"pretty much all independent": a hangman-style word, a grid of dice, a subtraction
problem in colored dots, letter grids, a darts scoreboard, poker hands, tic-tac-toe
boards, an alphabet spiral, a repeated phrase, a list of characters from a game, and a
board game. Each page is named `md5(N).html` for a decimal integer `N`, all 12 pages
using N of 2200 or less. On 2026-07-23 the author confirmed,
["all the words are necessarily part of the BIP-39 list"](https://x.com/FTPKgame/status/2080258068529492034),
and on 2026-07-25 gave the season's one hint:
["There is something that almost all the games have in common. Sometimes it won't really
help you, but at other times, you will absolutely need to keep that common element in
mind."](https://x.com/FTPKgame/status/2080976765401387082)
On 2026-07-22 the author said,
["In Season 4, there is a hidden page to help you with Season 2. This page is hidden in a
way that's a bit similar to Game 12 from Season 2."](https://x.com/FTPKgame/status/2079947035357102350)
That page is the same `md5()` naming scheme applied to the 12 Season 4 answer words
concatenated in game order.

## What is understood

### Mechanism

Twelve independent mini-games each resolve to one BIP39 word. The 12 words, in the
correct order, form a standard mnemonic; its BIP44 Ethereum address at
`m/44'/60'/0'/0/0` must equal the escrow exactly. The word order is a minor convenience
rather than a real lock: only 1 in 16 of the 12-factorial orderings of any given 12-word
set passes the BIP39 checksum, about 30 million candidates, searchable offline in about
30 minutes on 16 cores once the word set itself is known. The author confirmed as much
directly, describing the order-helper page as providing "the exact word order so you can
withdraw funds from the wallet" rather than being a puzzle in its own right.

### Derivation and oracle

```
python3 tools/oracle.py --selftest                              # public BIP39/BIP44 vector
python3 tools/oracle.py "twelve english words in a guessed order"
python3 tools/oracle.py --stdin                                  # one candidate per line
```

`MATCH <address>` on a hit, `NO MATCH` otherwise; a candidate with an invalid BIP39
checksum is reported as a checksum failure rather than derived.

### Certified against

`tools/oracle.py --selftest` reproduces the standard public BIP39 test mnemonic, 12
repetitions of "abandon" followed by "about", deriving to
`0x9858EfFD232B4033E47d90003D41EC34EcaEda94` under `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`. No worked example
specific to this season has been published by the author, unlike Season 2's Game 11.

### Established facts

1. The escrow holds 168.000000 USDC and a 0.00053941261264344 ETH gas preload, with 0
   outgoing transactions ever, checked via `eth_call` to the USDC contract and
   `eth_getTransactionCount` on 2026-08-16.
2. The prize grows one dollar at a time, and its deposit history is a public activity
   meter on the rest of the field. The author funded it once, 153.000000 USDC on
   2026-07-11, and every later deposit is exactly 1.000000 USDC: the price of one use of
   the paid word checker, which pays into the prize. Fifteen such payments have landed,
   the first on 2026-08-10 and the two most recent on 2026-08-16, from three distinct
   wallets (10 payments, 4 payments, and 1). Someone else is working this season now, and
   the deposit timestamps say when.
3. The author confirmed all 12 words are drawn from the standard BIP39 English wordlist.
4. The page-naming scheme, `md5(N).html` for a decimal integer `N`, is confirmed for all
   12 games (every N is 2200 or less).
5. The hidden page's name is 12 concatenated BIP39 words:
   `service cricket gloom attend supreme jump annual eager pulp project disease round`.
   All 12 are in the English wordlist, and in that order they form a mnemonic whose BIP39
   checksum is valid, which only 1 ordering in 16 does.
6. Game 1's page integer is 1570, and 1570 is the 1-based position of `service` in the
   BIP39 English wordlist: the first word of the hidden page's name. Two facts established
   separately, one by brute-forcing `md5(N)` against the game pages and one by reading the
   hidden page's URL, land on the same word, which is a 1-in-2048 coincidence otherwise.
   This is the strongest available reading of the author's "something in common" hint:
   each game's page integer is the 1-based BIP39 index of that game's own answer word. It
   costs me an earlier finding: I had read game 1's hangman as the 4-letter `frog`, and
   `service` cannot fit a 4-letter pattern, so one of the two readings is wrong. The index
   reading is the one with independent support, and `frog` is now a candidate I would drop
   rather than defend.
7. Under that reading the other 11 page integers are predicted exactly, and anyone with
   site access can falsify this in a minute: game 2 is 412, then 796, 117, 1744, 968, 76,
   552, 1388, 1377, 505, 1508 in the hidden page's word order. Every one is under 2200,
   which is the bound the page sweep already measured.
8. Game 10, a repeated phrase reading "again and again", is a strong candidate for the
   word `repeat`, pending confirmation alongside the other 11 words.

Full ledger in [analysis/tested.md](analysis/tested.md). Summary:

| Hypothesis | Space | Method | Result | Witness | Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Page-naming integer N as a direct BIP39 wordlist index | 1 candidate per game, checked against game 1's pattern | compare index N to the BIP39 word at that position | refuted: neither word at index 1570 fits game 1's hangman pattern | uncertified | 2026-07-26 |
| 13th hidden page search (N up to 2200, thematic words, N up to 36,000) | approximately 34,000 URLs | HTTP probe, 200/404 signature | refuted: no extra page beyond the Season 2 hint page | uncertified | 2026-07-26 |
| Letter grids (games 4, 6, 9) as plain word searches | full BIP39 wordlist and a 75,145-word English dictionary, all 8 directions, length 4 or more | grid search | refuted as a classic word search: 2 incidental matches in game 4, 0 in games 6 and 9 | uncertified | 2026-07-26 |
| Hidden links in the page markup | full site mirror | grep for anchors and `data-*` attributes | refuted: none found | yes | 2026-07-26 |

## Open leads, ranked

1. **Identify the common mechanic across the 12 games** (hours). The leading reading,
   from the author's own hint and the games built around dice, darts, and a board game,
   is that each game yields a number usable as a 1-to-2048 index into the BIP39 wordlist.
   Confirmed by a reading that correctly derives 2 or more of the already-established
   words from their games' own numbers; killed by a full 12-word attempt that fails under
   every indexing convention tried.
2. **Solve the remaining games directly** (hours), since the word order is not a real
   lock once the set of 12 words is known. Confirmed by a full 12-word candidate matching
   the escrow; killed only by exhausting every game's plausible readings.
