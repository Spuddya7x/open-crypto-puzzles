oracle.py -- candidate checker for the Aoi Nakamoto Quizchain puzzle.

Purpose:
    Given a candidate text, reproduce the puzzle's confirmed transform: MD5 the
    UTF-8 bytes of the text to get 128 bits of entropy, turn that entropy into a
    BIP39 mnemonic, derive BIP44 path m/44'/0'/0'/0/i for i = 0 to 5, and compare
    each resulting P2PKH address against the two open escrows (Real Big Block and
    Quizchain2 Block 76). A separate mode checks the two free MD5-prefix filters
    the author published for Block 76, ahead of any full derivation. A helper
    function reproduces the case-flip rule confirmed on the solved sibling lot
    Block 77 Stage One, for use on a candidate text you supply yourself.

    This script does not embed the text of Block 77 Stage One's source (Hal
    Finney's bitcointalk post) or of the Real Big Block's source (a Wattpad
    chapter): both are third-party or bulk material this repository does not
    redistribute. --selftest certifies the transform against the author's own
    published calibration vector instead, which needs no such text (see
    "Certified against" in the README for what this does and does not prove).

Usage:
    python3 tools/oracle.py --selftest                          # see README
    python3 tools/oracle.py "<candidate text>"                   # MD5 -> BIP39 -> derive
    python3 tools/oracle.py --stdin                              # one candidate per line
    python3 tools/oracle.py --block76-filter "<solution>" "<tomi>"   # free prefix filter
    python3 tools/oracle.py --flip-case "<paragraph>"            # apply the Stage One rule to one paragraph

Input:
    A candidate text string (the exact bytes to MD5), or, for --block76-filter, a
    solution string and a TOMI string, or, for --flip-case, one paragraph.

Output:
    "MATCH <label> <address> index=<i>" on a hit, "NO MATCH" otherwise.
    Exit 0 on any match, 1 if none.

Dependencies: stdlib, bip_utils.
