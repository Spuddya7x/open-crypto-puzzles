# Aoi Nakamoto Quizchain (0.854 BTC, [OPEN])

AoiNakamoto, a pseudonymous Reddit user, ran a series of roughly 90 self-funded
Bitcoin puzzle blocks from April to October 2019 on r/bitcoinpuzzles and her own
r/Grycoin, each with its own escrow address, question, and prize. She stopped
posting in October 2019 without ever reclaiming her own puzzle funds. Every
block was solved and swept by readers except the last two she published: the
second and final stage of "Real Big Block" (0.777 BTC) and "Quizchain2 Block
76" (0.077 BTC), both still funded seven years later. The MD5-to-BIP39
derivation mechanism is confirmed exactly, including a case-flip rule proven on
a solved sibling lot; what remains is the precise source text for Real Big
Block and a short answer to a word riddle for Block 76.

| Status | OPEN |
| Puzzle type | bip39-seed, word-selection |
| Target format | source text (candidate answer), MD5 to 128-bit entropy, BIP39 mnemonic, BIP44 `m/44'/0'/0'/0/i` for i = 0 to 5, P2PKH address |
| Certified oracle | yes: `tools/oracle.py --selftest` (certified against the author's own published entropy-to-WIF vector; see "Certified against" for what is and is not covered) |
| What remains | Real Big Block: which paragraphs of which chapter she hashed. The transform, the case-flip rule and now the separator's exact bytes (CR LF CR LF, in her own words) are all confirmed, and the candidate source text is 33 chapters rather than 1. Block 76: a short answer to a published word riddle, since no derivation of the one candidate chain found by search reaches the address |
| Series | this folder covers the 2 open lots of the approximately 90-block Quizchain series; the rest were solved by other readers in 2019 |

## The puzzle as published

AoiNakamoto's last two blocks, in order:

Real Big Block stage 1, 2019-07-07
([reddit.com/r/Grycoin/comments/ca6jxv](https://www.reddit.com/r/Grycoin/comments/ca6jxv/77_mbtc_quizchain2_block_77_stage_one/)):
"I do disclose that this one has no TOMI field, but that is all. You are on your
own completely." Its question links to Hal Finney's "Bitcoin and me" post on
bitcointalk (topic 155054). She adds: "I will publish the complete solution as
the Second stage of this block. This solution will in turn be the question for
the Second stage, which will have the final 777 mbtc prize." This stage's
escrow, `19TbyN5KCg1Lg7qHwezifsLVcdSa2Rj5KN`, was solved and swept on
2019-08-03; it is not part of the live prize and is used in this folder only to
certify the case-flip rule (see "What is understood").

Quizchain2 Block 76, 2019-07-22
([reddit.com/r/Grycoin/comments/cgcv9i](https://www.reddit.com/r/Grycoin/comments/cgcv9i/77_mbtc_quizchain2_block_76/)):
"Question: change to", "Format: [solution] TOMI [TOMI]", "First three digits of
MD5 hash are f8e". A later update adds "First two digits of solution only are
1d", and a hint changes the question to "from change to". She adds: "I will
shut down soon now [...] so I will not be available for hints or questions."

Real Big Block stage 2, published as a chapter titled "Second" on the author's
own Wattpad account
([wattpad.com/720888559-second](https://www.wattpad.com/720888559-second)). In
the "Real Big Block Discussion" thread
([reddit.com/r/Grycoin/comments/chn8un](https://www.reddit.com/r/Grycoin/comments/chn8un/real_big_block_discussion/)),
she writes, 2019-07-25: "When I posted the real big block at the Wattpad site,
I added extra line breaks between paragraphs. This information is needed to
solve the block." On 2019-07-31, after moving the funds to the current escrow:
"I took back the prize for a moment and sent it again to a new address, hashing
with a slightly different solution [...] It has multiple paragraphs and two
line breaks between each of them."

## What is understood

### Mechanism

Every block in the series follows the same transform: MD5 the exact bytes of a
source text to get 128 bits of entropy, generate a BIP39 mnemonic from that
entropy, derive BIP44 path `m/44'/0'/0'/0/i` (the author confirms taking a low
index, typically the first), and compare the resulting P2PKH address to the
block's escrow. Block 76 additionally uses a `[solution] TOMI [tomi]` format,
where TOMI (Japanese for "wealth") is a second, separately-hinted field: an
anti-brute-force device, since guessing the solution alone is not enough to
reach the hash.

![Source text to P2PKH address, five stages linked by MD5, BIP39 and BIP44](images/01-pipeline-derivation.svg)
*Figure 1. The MD5-to-address derivation pipeline (source: data/pipeline-stages.json, script tools/fig_pipeline.py), 2026-08-16.*

For Real Big Block, the source text is a chapter of the author's Wattpad story, with a
case-flip rule applied to some of its paragraphs, not the chapter's raw text. The rule is
proven on the solved sibling lot Block 77 Stage One: of that post's 16 paragraphs, the 4
whose first letter is not I, T, A, S or M get their first letter lowercased and their last
letter uppercased, and the paragraphs are joined with a blank line; this reproduces
`19TbyN5KCg1Lg7qHwezifsLVcdSa2Rj5KN` exactly. The "Second" chapter contains the same
paragraph-initial pattern 3 times on its own, plus a quotation from the Finney post, but no
combination of applying the rule to these 4 candidate groups (nor to the many related
selections in `analysis/tested.md`) reproduces either the current or the superseded Real
Big Block address.

Two constraints on the exact bytes are now settled, and both narrow this a great deal. The
separator is CR LF, not a bare newline: the author gives its ASCII codes outright in the
discussion thread (established fact 10), so the live answer joins paragraphs with
`\r\n\r\n` and the superseded one with `\r\n`. And the candidate source is 33 chapters
rather than 1 (established fact 11), several of them written in the week the escrow was
funded. The Wattpad API confirms `Second`'s `modifyDate` as 2019-07-23T23:12:04Z, 7 days
before the current escrow was funded, so the text available today predates the funding; the
chapter is still the leading candidate, but it is no longer the only one, and the standalone
`The Satoshi Code` covers the same material in 146 paragraphs of its own.

For Block 76, a community player found, in 2019, that `solution = "format"`,
`tomi = "before TOMI"` satisfies both published MD5-prefix hints (`1d` and
`f8e`); the free filter for checking this yourself is
`tools/oracle.py --block76-filter`. No standard derivation of this pair reaches
the escrow address, and the author never corrected the block after the pair was
posted publicly, which argues this chain is a coincidental false positive
rather than her real answer (see "What has been tested").

### Derivation and oracle

```
python3 tools/oracle.py --selftest
python3 tools/oracle.py "<candidate text>"
python3 tools/oracle.py --stdin
python3 tools/oracle.py --block76-filter "<solution>" "<tomi>"
python3 tools/oracle.py --flip-case "<one paragraph>"
```

Given a candidate text, the oracle MD5s its UTF-8 bytes, derives BIP44 indices 0
through 5, and compares each resulting address against both open escrows.
`--block76-filter` checks the 2 free MD5-prefix hints before any derivation.
`--flip-case` applies the confirmed Stage One rule to one paragraph you supply.
This script ships no source text of its own: Real Big Block's source (a Wattpad
chapter) and the Stage One certification text (a bitcointalk post by Hal
Finney) are both excluded, the first as bulk chapter content and the second as
third-party historical material neither the puzzle's author nor this repository
holds the rights to. Supply your own candidate text to test it.

### Certified against

`tools/oracle.py --selftest` reproduces the author's own published calibration
vector, given in the round-1 corpus: entropy `2941774a2abec9f30c7d6777d1d53d91`,
at BIP44 index 1 ("my 2nd private key"), derives WIF
`L5Z66qPmUkTAsWQywjRNHDxHrX6J1X1SQedp6V8QsbaXR7rGd6ex` exactly, and that WIF
appears at no other index. This certifies the MD5-to-address transform itself,
without needing any third-party text. The selftest also checks the
`--flip-case` helper against a synthetic (non-puzzle) example sentence, and the
`--block76-filter` helper against the community-found `format` / `before TOMI`
pair.

This does not, by itself, reproduce Block 77 Stage One end to end, since that
needs Hal Finney's bitcointalk post text, which this repository does not ship.
Anyone who supplies that text (freely readable at bitcointalk topic 155054) can
reproduce it themselves with `apply_stage_one_rule()` in `tools/oracle.py`; I
did this during research and it reproduces `19TbyN5KCg1Lg7qHwezifsLVcdSa2Rj5KN`
exactly, which is the basis for the case-flip rule described above.

Reproduced 2026-08-16.

### Established facts

1. Both escrows are funded and unspent as of 2026-08-16: `14zMkTgaVXJcxdh4JdWi29MLRR44iUSG9W`
   holds 0.777 BTC (funded 2019-07-30, block 587833) and
   `13Cv6SXUnzGDT8JHqzzJ8xMPtsSdhJA4wd` holds 0.077 BTC (funded 2019-07-22,
   block 586468), checked via [mempool.space](https://mempool.space).
2. Across the approximately 90 blocks of the series, these are the only 2 still
   funded: an exhaustive sweep of all 159 funding transactions cited in the
   author's 202 Reddit posts found 0 unreadable transactions and exactly these
   2 unspent above 100,000 sats.
3. The MD5-to-BIP39-to-BIP44 transform is confirmed exactly against the
   author's own published calibration vector (above).
4. The case-flip rule is confirmed exactly against the solved sibling lot Block
   77 Stage One (above), reproducing its escrow address byte for byte.
5. The Real Big Block chapter's Wattpad `modifyDate` (2019-07-23) predates the
   current escrow's funding (2019-07-30) by 7 days, and the chapter has not
   been modified since, confirmed via the Wattpad API.
6. No archived capture of the "Second" Wattpad chapter from 2019 exists on the
   Wayback Machine, archive.today, or Common Crawl, checked across 8 URL forms
   and 5 time-windowed collections; a positive control query on each service
   confirms the services themselves were responding, so these are true absences
   in the archive, not failed lookups.
7. The chain `MD5("format") ` starts with `1d` and `MD5("format TOMI before TOMI")`
   starts with `f8e`, matching both prefixes the author published for Block 76;
   neither of 2 other independently solved calibration blocks (73 and 74) shows
   any sign this chain is the author's real answer.
8. Real Big Block has 2 doors, not 1, and every sweep should aim at both. The author
   funded `1EFojcAo2vbhRGCGCa7q8Wwvzss28mhQYC` on 2019-07-24, then moved the prize on
   2019-07-30 after "hashing with a slightly different solution", and her own 2 posts
   pin down what "slightly different" means: the old answer had "only one line break
   between paragraphs" and the new one has "two line breaks between each of them". The
   paragraph text is therefore the same in both; only the separator changed. The
   superseded address holds nothing, but recovering its text hands over the live answer
   for free, so it belongs in the target set of every candidate sweep. It costs no extra
   derivations, since one derived address is compared against all targets at once.
9. The chapter's stored markup contains 10 `<br>` tags inside its 273 `<p>` blocks. Those
   are single line breaks that survived the paste to the site rather than being doubled
   into paragraph breaks, which is a direct fingerprint of the "extra line breaks" edit
   the author says is needed to solve the block, and reading them as paragraph boundaries
   gives a 283-paragraph text that no earlier sweep used as its base.
10. **The separator is CR LF, not a bare newline.** Asked in the discussion thread whether
    "two line breaks" meant one Enter press or two, the author answered: "I mean the second
    one. Hit enter twice. This displays in Ascii as 13 10 13 10, according to
    asciivalue.com." ASCII 13 10 is CR LF, so the live answer joins its paragraphs with
    `\r\n\r\n` and the superseded one with `\r\n`. She was typing in a Windows editor. Every
    row of the negatives ledger dated before 2026-08-17 used bare newlines as its primary
    convention, which means the whole search has been running one byte per line break away
    from what she published.
11. The author's Wattpad account holds one story, "Second", of **33 chapters**, not the 1
    this folder tracked. Her profile reads "Born to publish one story"; the story's own
    description is "Hint for block 77". Four chapters were written in the week the escrow
    was funded, including a standalone 146-paragraph `The Satoshi Code`, and 2 more are her
    own indexes of every solved block with its question, solution and TOMI field. Part list
    and paragraph counts in `data/wattpad-chapters.json`; quotes in `clues/author-posts.md`.

## Open leads, ranked

1. **Reconstruct the 2019 browser-copy rendering of the Wattpad chapter**
   (hours). The chapter's API storage today has no blank paragraphs, but the
   author describes typing 2 line breaks between paragraphs; Wattpad likely
   normalized this away, and what she hashed was probably what her browser
   rendered and she copied in 2019, not today's raw storage. Confirmed by
   re-testing the already-tried paragraph selections against a faithfully
   reconstructed 2019 rendering; killed if that still does not match.
2. **Read the 27 posts and comments between the rehash and the shutdown**
   (about an hour). The author posted 2019-07-30 to 2019-08-04 before going
   silent; these have been read once for an explicit hint but not re-read
   systematically against the now-narrower list of untested paragraph
   combinations. Confirmed by a new detail that, applied and tested, matches;
   killed by a full re-read producing nothing new.
3. **A bounded 2-character-edit sweep on the strongest base texts** (about an
   hour on a rented GPU). The 1-character sweep is exhaustive; a 2-character
   sweep restricted to the small set of NBSP and line-ending pairs, rather than
   every position, is a bounded extension. Confirmed by a match in that bounded
   space; killed by exhausting it with none.
4. **Identify what "76" indexes for Block 76** (minutes per candidate corpus).
   A method confirmed on 3 sibling blocks uses the block number as a position
   index into a specific numbered corpus; every corpus tried so far does not
   contain "change" at position 76. Confirmed by a match in an untried corpus
   (candidates include a fuller archive of Hal Finney's tweets, Satoshi's
   SourceForge posts, or the author's own r/Grycoin posts read as their own
   sequence); killed by exhausting the remaining candidate corpora.
5. **A short, human-reasoned answer to "change to" / "from change to"**
   (minutes per candidate). The author's confirmed style elsewhere in the
   series favors short, punchy wordplay answers over long dictionary phrases; a
   free filter (`tools/oracle.py --block76-filter`) checks any candidate in
   under a second before a full derivation. This lead has no exhaustion
   condition; it is a standing invitation, same as any human-reasoned wordplay
   block in the series.
