## Real Big Block (0.777 BTC)

The mechanism is certified (the case-flip rule reproduces the solved sibling lot
Block 77 Stage One exactly). What is not established is exactly which paragraphs
of the "Second" chapter the author modified on 2019-07-30, and the precise text
she copied. Every row below tests a specific hypothesis about that, against both
the current escrow (`14zMkTgaVXJcxdh4JdWi29MLRR44iUSG9W`) and its superseded
predecessor (`1EFojcAo2vbhRGCGCa7q8Wwvzss28mhQYC`).

| Hypothesis family | Candidates | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Chapter unmodified, every plausible serialization (line-break style, encoding) | approximately 150,000 | 0 match |
| Certified case-flip rule applied to the 3 planted paragraph groups plus the Finney quote, 16 combinations, both letter-position modes | approximately 200,000 | 0 match |
| Every subset of the 17 candidate paragraphs (2^17), 18 serialization variants | 2,360,000 | 0 match |
| Paragraphs selected by a name or word ("Satoshi", "Aoi Nakamoto", "Hal Finney", "Grycoin", and 7 more), by first letter or first character | approximately 10,000 | 0 match |
| Every paragraph starting with F or W (and F, W, H) | approximately 1,000 | 0 match |
| The certified groups plus one arbitrary extra paragraph | 13,000 | 0 match |
| The certified groups plus two arbitrary extra paragraphs | approximately 600,000 | 0 match |
| The single-word planted correction from block 29 ("voice" to "vOIce"), alone and combined with the groups | 6,000 | 0 match |
| Block-29-style link suffixes appended to the text | 8,000 | 0 match |
| Chapter subsections read alone | 3,000 | 0 match |
| Page-level prefixes (duplicated title, author byline) | 2,000 | 0 match |
| A simulated Chromium browser copy (selection/innerText rendering rules) | 1,000 | 0 match |
| Alternate text encodings (Latin-1, UTF-16, cp1252, NBSP normalization) | 3,000 | 0 match |
| Simulated-browser-copy base combined with the name/word selectors, then with all 2^17 paragraph subsets | approximately 800,000 | 0 match |
| A single invisible character (BOM, zero-width space, tab, and 6 more) inserted at the start or end | 5,000 | 0 match |
| Paragraphs selected by the letters of "Satoshi Nakamoto" specifically (a refinement of the name-selector row above, after finding the Finney post has a paragraph starting with M) | 60 | 0 match |
| Last-letter-only or first-letter-only variants of the case-flip rule, on the certified groups | 456 texts (2,736 address checks across derivation indices) | 0 match |
| All of the above serialization families repeated under CRLF line endings | 2,448 texts (14,688 address checks) | 0 match |
| 1 to 3 single-letter case toggles across all sign positions, and 1 to 2 across all paragraph boundaries | 1,450,000 | 0 match |
| Every single-character edit (insert, delete, replace, case toggle) at every position, across 40 base texts (5 paragraph-set choices x 2 NBSP conventions x 2 line-ending conventions x 2 separator conventions) | 266,038,400 | 0 match |

Witness status: every row above used the oracle certified against Block 77 Stage
One (see README, "Certified against"); the single-character-edit row additionally
planted 3 synthetic witnesses per base text (head, middle, tail) and recovered
all of them on all 40 bases, plus recovered the real Stage One text and address
when run as a 41st base. Dates: all rows 2026-08-15.

Cumulative for Real Big Block: approximately 272 million candidates tested, 0
match. The single-character-edit sweep accounts for the large majority of this
total and is the only row certified as a complete sweep of its stated space (all
40 bases, every single edit); every other row is a targeted, not exhaustive,
test of one specific hypothesis about which paragraphs were modified.

### Contiguous paragraph ranges of the chapter, 2026-08-17

Every row above picks paragraphs by some property (a planted group, a name, a first
letter). This sweep picks them by position instead and closes that shape completely: every
one of the 37,401 contiguous ranges of the chapter's 273 paragraphs, each under 2
paragraph forms (as stored, and whitespace-stripped), 2 rule states (unmodified, and the
certified case-flip applied), 4 separator conventions and both trailing-newline choices,
which is 32 candidate texts per range and 1,196,832 in total, each derived at 3 address
indexes.

The target set is 4 addresses, not 2: both open escrows, the solved Stage One address, and
the superseded Real Big Block address `1EFojcAo2vbhRGCGCa7q8Wwvzss28mhQYC`. Adding the
superseded one costs nothing and doubles the chance of a hit, because the author says the
two differ only slightly and describes the difference as the line-break count, so recovering
the old text hands over the paragraph set for the live one.

Result: 1,196,832 candidate texts derived in 9.3 minutes on 4 cores (2,142 per second), 0
match. Planted witness recovered: a real candidate from inside the sweep's own space
(paragraphs 100 to 104, stripped, case-flip applied, blank-line separator) whose address was
added to the target set and was reported by the slice that covers it.

This closes "the answer is a contiguous run of the chapter's paragraphs, as stored". It does
not close non-contiguous selections, which is where the earlier subset rows sit.

### A reconstruction note the sweeps above do not cover

The chapter's stored markup is 273 `<p>` blocks containing 10 `<br>` tags. A `<br>` is a
displayed line break that never became its own paragraph, which is exactly the artifact the
author describes: she typed single line breaks, the site would not render them, so she
doubled them, and the 10 that stayed `<br>` are single breaks that survived the paste.
Reading them as paragraph boundaries gives 283 paragraphs rather than 273, a different byte
sequence from anything in the rows above. Tested on 2026-08-17 across 4 reconstructions
(as stored, split on `<br>`, split and stripped, `<br>` replaced in place by a newline), 4
leading offsets, both rule states, both line-break conventions and both trailing choices:
128 texts at 6 address indexes, 0 match, witness reproduced through the same code path. The
reconstruction stays on the table as a base for other selections; only these 128 are closed.

## Quizchain2 Block 76 (0.077 BTC)

The chain a community player found in 2019 (`solution = "format"`,
`TOMI = "before TOMI"`) satisfies both of the author's published MD5-prefix
hints, but no standard BIP44/49/84 derivation, derivation path, or passphrase
variant of it produces the escrow address. Two later calibration checks (blocks
73 and 74, both already solved and swept, not part of the live prize) confirm
the derivation code itself is correct, and a later cross-check on 2019-07-29
comment timing suggests the "format" chain was itself a false positive found by
searching for strings that pass the 2 published prefixes, rather than the
author's real answer, since the author never corrected the block after seeing it
posted publicly (see README).

Standard-derivation sweep on the `format`/`before TOMI` chain:

| Hypothesis family | Candidates | Result |
|---|---|---|
| BIP44, BIP49, BIP84, accounts 0 to 4, external and internal chains, index 0 to 199 (BIP44 external: 0 to 1999) | standard derivation space | 0 match |
| Non-standard derivation paths (Coleman-style m/0'/0/i, m/0/i, m/0', root key) | small, enumerated | 0 match |
| Passphrase variants ("TOMI", "format", "before TOMI", bracket and whitespace forms) | small, enumerated | 0 match |
| Alternate entropy functions (SHA-256 as a 24-word mnemonic, SHA-1, RIPEMD-160, truncated SHA-512, double MD5) | small, enumerated | 0 match |
| Off-by-one word at BIP39 import (12 positions x 2,047 alternate words each) | 24,564 | 0 match |
| Word order reversed | 1 | 0 match |

Word-transform "salves" on the question "change to" / "from change to" (each
family's candidate solution strings tested through the same 2 MD5-prefix filters
before any derivation; only pairs passing both filters were derivation-tested):

| Salve | Candidate solutions | Passed prefix 1d | Passed both filters (derivation-tested) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Single-letter edits, anagrams, Atbash/ROT/foldover, translations of "change" | 7,730 | 32 | 3,506 TOMI pairs, 0 match |
| WordNet synsets and hyper/hyponyms of change/alter | 20,199 | 74 | 8,806 TOMI pairs, 0 match |
| Wikipedia article titles containing "change" | 14,666 | 44 | 4,949 TOMI pairs, 0 match |
| Sentences from Satoshi/Hal Finney bitcointalk posts and emails containing "change to" | 46 | 0 | n/a |
| Sentences from bitcointalk posts numbered 60 to 94 (2 orderings) | 1,992 | 11 (noise) | n/a |
| Strings built from the number 76 (years, technical constants, ordinals) | 3,779 | 23 (noise) | n/a |
| Encodings of "change" (hex, base64, NATO alphabet, Morse, keyboard shift) | approximately 130 | 1 (noise) | n/a |
| "changeto" (no space) combined with TOMI variants | 1 | 1 | 1,701 TOMI pairs, 0 match |
| Every address and txid from the author's 158 other funding transactions | approximately 1,500 | 4 (case noise) | n/a |
| Renaming candidates ("wealth", "legacy", and similar) | 45 | 0 | n/a |
| An Easter/resurrection word family, echoing the same block number in round 1 | 2,752 | 17 (noise) | 5,857 TOMI pairs, 0 match |
| Halving-related terms | 45 | 1 (noise) | n/a |
| Grycoin/burn-address/second-layer terms from the chapter | 60 | 0 | n/a |
| Literal strings and typos from the block's own post | 45 | 0 | n/a |

A separate "post-number-as-index" method, confirmed on 3 other blocks in the
series (numbers 56, 57 and 58 each index a specific post or tweet by Satoshi or
Hal Finney, by position), does not carry over to block 76: post number 76 in
every corpus and ordering tried (Satoshi's bitcointalk posts newest-first and
chronological, Hal Finney's posts, Hal Finney's tweets) contains neither "change"
nor "from".

A large dictionary-times-corpus sweep tested every 1-to-4-word phrase built from
the author's own writing (Reddit posts, comments, and Wattpad chapters) as a
candidate TOMI value, against a dictionary-and-WordNet-derived candidate solution
list: 189,565 candidate solutions passing the first filter, times 656,845 to
1,250,000 candidate TOMI phrases depending on the pass, for a combined total of
approximately 3.2x10^11 MD5 computations and approximately 78 million full
address derivations on the pairs that passed both filters. 0 match. The
derivation code was re-confirmed correct on both calibration blocks (73 and 74)
at the head, middle and tail of this run.

Cumulative for Block 76: approximately 78 million address derivations from the
scripted dictionary sweep, plus approximately 53,000 smaller thematic candidates
across the 14 salves above, plus the full standard-derivation sweep on the one
chain found by search. 0 match anywhere. This is reported as a targeted, not
exhaustive, negative: the true solution may use vocabulary outside the corpora
swept (the author's own writing and 2 general-purpose dictionaries), and the
block may simply be misconfigured (see README).
